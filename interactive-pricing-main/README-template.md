## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to style a range slider with a progress bar that transforms its color according to user interaction. To make it possible, I need to use the DOM tree to change dynamically the progress bar width. However, there is a little prank about this range slider because the challenge force us to define steps in range slider. Since you can't define the slider between 0 and 100, I needed to create a object and define the key as the slider value and the value as the pageviews, the price and the value width. In this way, the progress bar width was precisely defined at the same time user interaction. Look the code:

```js
const priceTable = {
    1: ['10K', 8, 0],
    2: ['50K', 12, 25],
    3: ['100K', 16, 50],
    4: ['500K', 24, 75],
    5: ['1M', 36, 100]
}

const sliderInteraction = function() {
    const sliderValue = Number(Object.keys(priceTable).filter(key => key === slider.value));
    
    const progressValue = priceTable[sliderValue][2];    
    progressBar.style.width = `${progressValue}%`;
}
```

I learned a lot about toggle button in CSS. This was my first styling experience with this type of button.
In JavaScript, I've enforced the functions responsible for the DOM tree, like querySelector and the usage of the browser console.
Also, I managed to write the code as clean as possible and tried to define readable identifiers.

### Continued development

I think I need to reinforce the DOM tree and its methods. Also, I'll try to learn more about toggle button and the operator selector in CSS. 

In JavaScript, I'm very very happy because I did everything by my own. However, I think it's necessary to study about Desing Patterns in order to organize better the algorithm. 

Soon, I'll start to learn Sass to enable faster writing in CSS.
